# Rotating Nav - A code along from Brad Traversy's youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtunPQtr-Xw

## Overview
- The task was to build a landing page, any content of choice
- Add nice transitions to make the processs smooth
- Reveal the transitions at a point on scroll on the window

## Challenge
- The ul transitions didn't show in responsive mode
- I didn't make it as responsive on different screen sizes as I should have

## Future Study:
- I hope to keep learning and improving on previous knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Learn about methods, events in Javascript also
